How to play the game: The rule to play this game is simple. Just go to the link not working now (https://dipgau.github.io/) and you will find the user interface to play the game. There are two players in this game and each can roll the dice. If the use rolls the dice and the dice is not number 1, then the user gets another chance to roll the dice and the previous score from the dice is added and this continues unless the user hits number 1 when rolling the dice or the user can save the score he/she accumulated from throwing the dice multiple times by pressing the hold button. And, when their turn comes again, new score is added to the previous score.When the user gets number 1 or presses the hold button, then the turn is transferred to another player and the game is played in the same style. Whoever gets the score 100 first becomes the winner. If the player wants to start the new game or reset while playing, he/she canpress the new game button and the game is re-started.
